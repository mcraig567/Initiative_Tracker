Web app to monitor turns in DND

Allows user to track spells casted in battle and tells user when spells have expired

Currently uses database to track initiative/spell duration. Also used to populate/sort the initiative list. Future versions to have JS script sort the initiative div list so that can be hosted on git pages.
